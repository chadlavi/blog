I"¥<p>As a library developer, managing your <code class="highlighter-rouge">yarn link</code>-ed libraries can be tough. I often have my front-end library yarn-linked into one or more of my companyâ€™s FE apps locally to test out changes, but thereâ€™s no simple utility to tell you what libraries are currently yarn-linked, much less to tell you whether there are any yarn-linked packages in use in your current app. If something is broken, it could be difficult to tell if itâ€™s broken <em>in the deployed version</em> of the library or <em>in the local version Iâ€™ve yarn linked</em>. Did I yarn link the library into this project last week and forget to remove the link?</p>
