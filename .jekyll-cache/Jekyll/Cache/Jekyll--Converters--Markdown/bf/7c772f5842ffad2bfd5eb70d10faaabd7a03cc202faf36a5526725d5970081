<p>When we first started working on <a href="https://prsnt.app">prsnt.app</a>, my cofounder Pete made a simple screencap explainer video to show how it worked. It was simple, it was quick, it was cheap.</p>

<p>But when we started to gain traction, it became clear that we needed to make a more polished looking video.</p>

<p>I made the following video in Adobe Premiere Pro. We filmed Peteâ€™s hands turning the pages in our office. The voiceover was provided by a VO artist from voicebunny.com (I highly recommend them), the music is from incompetech.com (also highly recommend him), and I took all the screencap video on my macbook. It took about 5 hours of total production and editing work, not including the business day or so of turnaround time for the voiceover.</p>

<p>I also made a brief video tag for prsnt.app, so that others can append it to their screencap tutorial videos and maintain brand identity, without making me a bottleneck in their video editing/uploading workflow.</p>

<p>This is a video I produced for us at Arazoo.com back in late 2016/early 2017. The video was shot and edited by my friend <a href="https://www.noahtherrien.com/">Noah Therrien</a> at <a href="http://www.sandenwolff.com">Sanden Wolff</a>. I wrote the script for this video, recruited/managed talent, and reviewed/critiqued edits.</p>
