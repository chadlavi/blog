I"ã<p>Hiring our new CTO, Peter Stern, back in early 2017 was an excellent opportunity for us at Arazoo to reexamine some of the design decisions that were made early on but were no longer carrying their weight. Peter was fresh to our org and had no emotional ties to our existing code. Whereas Iâ€™d had problems in the past getting user testing and user experience at the front of the process, Pete naturally gravitated towards the â€œletâ€™s go talk to peopleâ€ side of things.</p>
