<p>In the fall of 2017, we experimented with allowing users to review products and materials on Arazoo, to share publicly with the userbase.</p>

<p>In this prototype, you can review a product, attaching your own images, rating the product, and giving your sentiment on the product‚Äôs price.</p>

<h2 id="arazoo-collections">Arazoo Collections</h2>

<p>In early 2018, we started work on a new community feature for Arazoo called Collections‚Äîbasically, it was a way for users to blog about combinations of finishes and materials within the Arazoo platform. This was the prototype I made for the initial version.</p>

<p>In this prototype, you can create a collection, customize it with a header image, and add text.</p>
