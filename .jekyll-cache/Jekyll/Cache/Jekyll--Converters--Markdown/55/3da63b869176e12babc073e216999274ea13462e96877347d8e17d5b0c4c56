I"‘<p>I originally created this blog as an excuse to experiment with <a href="https://jamstack.org/">the JAM stack</a>, but I quickly realized I didnâ€™t really need any CRUD functionality; itâ€™s just a blog, no forms or uploads to speak of. The initial code for that never made it to a git repo, and frankly didnâ€™t get too far past an <code class="highlighter-rouge">npx create-react-app</code>.</p>
