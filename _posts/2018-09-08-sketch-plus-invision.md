## Arazoo Product Reviews

In the fall of 2017, we experimented with allowing users to review products and materials on Arazoo, to share publicly with the userbase. 

In this prototype, you can review a product, attaching your own images, rating the product, and giving your sentiment on the product's price.

## Arazoo Collections

In early 2018, we started work on a new community feature for Arazoo called Collections&mdash;basically, it was a way for users to blog about combinations of finishes and materials within the Arazoo platform. This was the prototype I made for the initial version. 

In this prototype, you can create a collection, customize it with a header image, and add text.
