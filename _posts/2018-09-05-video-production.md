## prsnt.app promotional video
When we first started working on [prsnt.app](https://prsnt.app), my cofounder Pete made a simple screencap explainer video to show how it worked. It was simple, it was quick, it was cheap. 

But when we started to gain traction, it became clear that we needed to make a more polished looking video. 

I made the following video in Adobe Premiere Pro. We filmed Pete's hands turning the pages in our office. The voiceover was provided by a VO artist from voicebunny.com (I highly recommend them), the music is from incompetech.com (also highly recommend him), and I took all the screencap video on my macbook. It took about 5 hours of total production and editing work, not including the business day or so of turnaround time for the voiceover.

## prsnt.app video tag

I also made a brief video tag for prsnt.app, so that others can append it to their screencap tutorial videos and maintain brand identity, without making me a bottleneck in their video editing/uploading workflow.

## Arazoo.com promotional video

This is a video I produced for us at Arazoo.com back in late 2016/early 2017. The video was shot and edited by my friend [Noah Therrien](https://www.noahtherrien.com/) at [Sanden Wolff](http://www.sandenwolff.com). I wrote the script for this video, recruited/managed talent, and reviewed/critiqued edits.

## Arazoo.com explainer video

This is an explainer video I made for the homepage of Arazoo.com. I wrote the script, contracted the voice talent, took the screencap video, and edited it.
